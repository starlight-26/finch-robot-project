# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Timeline/Checklist

### Planning & Research
- Choose your challenge: dance, drawing, or maze navigation
- Explore the Finch API documentation
- Review sample programs from BirdBrain Technologies
- Create a project plan with pseudocode/flow charts/
- Clone and set up GitHub repository for your project

### Development
- Write initial code implementation
- Test basic functionality with the Finch robot
- Debug and refine your approach
- Document your progress and challenges

### Implementation & Testing
- Complete core functionality implementation
- Conduct thorough testing with the robot
- Optimize code for readability and efficiency
- Start preparing documentation

### Finalization
- Finalize code and ensure complete functionality
- Complete README documentation
- Prepare for demonstration
- Submit final project to GitHub

### Deployment
- Demonstrate your project

## Required Components

### Technical Requirements
Your program must include at least 5 of these Java/OOP concepts:
- Inheritance/Subclasses
- Method overloading or overriding
- Arrays or ArrayLists
- Loops (for, while, etc.)
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling
- File I/O for configuration or logging
- Constants and static methods
- User input processing

### Documentation Requirements
- Well-commented code with appropriate Javadoc
- GitHub repository with organized file structure
- README.md file including:
  * Project description and objectives
  * Description of design choices
  * Challenges faced and solutions
  * Future enhancements
  * Video or images of your robot in action (embedded or linked)

## Challenge-Specific Guidelines

### Dance Challenge
Create a choreographed dance routine for your Finch that synchronizes:
- Movement patterns (forward/backward, turns)
- LED light displays (beak and tail)
- Sound patterns using the buzzer
- Consider using arrays to store sequences of movements/lights/sounds

### Drawing Challenge
Program your Finch to create an artistic drawing:
- Design an algorithm to create a recognizable pattern or image
- Use precise motor control for clean lines
- Consider incorporating sensor data to affect the drawing
- Create a system to track position on the drawing surface

### Maze Navigation Challenge
Program your Finch to navigate through a maze:
- Use distance sensors to detect walls
- Implement an algorithm for maze solving (wall following, etc.)
- Consider storing and analyzing the path taken
- Add visual/audio feedback during navigation
- Optional: Allow for maze "learning" and optimization on repeated runs

## Resources
- Finch API Documentation (provided in class)
- [BirdBrain Technologies Learning Resources](https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/java/program/)
- [Java API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)

## Extension Opportunities
If you complete your chosen challenge early, consider:
- Adding sensor-responsive behaviors to your program
- Creating a user interface to control robot parameters (JFrame, Swing, JavaFX)
- Implementing multiple modes of operation
- Adding an obstacle detection and avoidance system

## Description of design choices
I chose to make my Finch Robot draw a star. I decided to do this because I love drawing stars and I thought it woud be th easiet thing for me to do.

## Challenges faced and solutions
A challenge I faced during the coding process was figuring out the angle that would make the Finch Robot draw a star correctly. Sometimes it would not connect and other times it would connect at the wrong place at the end. I ended finding that the right equation is ((2*360) / number of points) + 2.85. 

## Future enhancements
If I had more time, I would want to make my Finch Robot be able to draw stars of different sizes and different number of points. I think I could do this by making a method with those two as parameters. Then I could use the numbers to calculate the number of degrees the robot would need to turn.
